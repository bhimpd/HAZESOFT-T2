# HAZESOFT-T2
Firstly I have created the HAZESOFT-T2 repo in the github account.
Then I install the virtual box using the following command
Sudo apt update && sudo apt install virtualbox.
Once completed to run the virtualbox in the host computer, we use the command “virtualbox”.

Then we configure the setting and allocated memory as per the requirements

In that virtual box, we then run the terminal by pressing alt+ctrl+t
Then we install ansible using the following command.
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ansible
Then we create the hazesoft directory using following command
mkdir hazesoft
Then we go in that directory using the following command
cd hazesoft
Inside that directory we create the inventory named as “deploy.yml” and add some commands.
